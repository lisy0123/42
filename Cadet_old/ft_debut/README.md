1. Look up 3 job postings that match your career goals and write a comprehensive list of skills/proficiencies required for those postings.   
To have a job connecting the two fields of design and programming, I have to adapt and learn quickly to the situation of a rapidly changing era, and have a good sense of handling problems. Also, it needs to know about design as well as programming, and understand the differences between designers and programmers.

2. Look through the cadet curriculum and write a list of 2-3 projects that would help you work on some of those skills.   
Piscine CPP, Piscine Unity, FdF, HumanGL, Particle System

3. Why do we start learning programming in C instead of another language?   
Because C is the most basic language and learning C makes it easier to learn other languages.
